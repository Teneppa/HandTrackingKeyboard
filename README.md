# HandTrackingKeyboard
### Type with your hands!
Yeah this is yet another demo made with mediapipe that allows you to type in midair with your hands! And it is super annoying to use, because you can't see where the keyboard is, but if some day we could get this to a pair of Smart Glasses, then I guess it might be a bit more useful.

### Requirements:
#### Python packages:
* Mediapipe (pip3 install mediapipe)
* CV2 (pip3 install opencv-python)

#### Hardware:
* Webcam

And here's the YouTube video about this project:
